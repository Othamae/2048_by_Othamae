# 2048 Game

This is a browser-based implementation of the classic 2048 game, built with React. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the tile with a value of 2048.

## Rules of the Game

1. Use the buttons to move the tiles in the desired direction.
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with double the value.
3. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when the player reaches the 2048 tile.

## Features

- Players can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
- Game state is saved in local storage, so you can resume your game if you close the window or refresh the page.
- A winner modal appears when a player has won the game.
- Scoreboard that keeps track of your high scores.
